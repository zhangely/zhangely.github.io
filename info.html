    	<div id="leftColumn">National ASL Day is a day of observance celebrating American Sign Language. On April 15, 1817, the first school for the deaf in the United States opened. Students gathered there over the years and at subsequent deaf schools across our nation. The children intermingled Native American Signs, French Sign Language, and Martha’s Vineyard Sign Language. This process brought forth modern American Sign Language. According to Communication Services for the Deaf: 98% of deaf people do not receive education in sign language. 72% of families do not sign with their deaf children. 70% of deaf people don’t work or are underemployed. 1 in 4 deaf people has left a job due to discrimination. 1 in 4 deaf women will be sexually assaulted in their lifetimes, compared to 1 in 10 hearing women. According to NIDCD, nine out of ten children who are born deaf are born to parents who hear, which has also pushed the call for early education of ASL.
