/*
  TASK 2

  Model the variables you created for Task 1 as an object,
  and assign that object to a variable named `person1`.
  Pay close attention to syntax!

  Example:
  var person1 = {
    name: "Steven",
    major: "information design and visualization",
    year: 2020,
    favorites: ["Chrono Trigger", "Final Fantasy VI", "Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time"],
    fromBoston: false
  };

  */
  var person1 = {
    name: "Jack",
    major: "Design",
    year: 2023,
    favorites: ["Ratatouille", "Lilo & Stitch", "Toy Story"],
    fromBoston: true,
    yearsUntilGrad: 3
  };

  /*
  TASK 3

  Repeat this process for at least 2 additional classmates,
  creating 2 new variables named `person2` and `person3`.
  Follow the same object structure as above.

  */
 var person2 = {
    name: "Emily",
    major: "Psychology",
    year: 2020,
    favorites: ["Big Hero 6", "Finding Nemo", "Coco"],
    fromBoston: false,
    yearsUntilGrad: 0
  };
 var person3 = {
    name: "Ares",
    major: "CS & Design",
    year: 2024,
    favorites: ["Kingdom Hearts", "Pokemon", "Undertale"],
    fromBoston: false,
    yearsUntilGrad: 4
  };

  /*
  TASK 4

  Represent your 3 people data in an array of objects, assigned to
  a variable named `people`.
  Each object inside of your array should contain the same data that
  are included in `person1`, `person2`, and `person3` above.

  Pay close attention to syntax!

  Example:

  var people = [
    { ... },
    { ... },
    { ... }
  ];

  */

var people = [ 
 {person1},
 {person2},
 {person3},
];

  /*
  TASK 5

  Using a for() loop, iterate through each of the objects inside `people`.
  For each person inside `people`, create a variable named `sentence` that
  has the following string value:
  [NAME] is studying [MAJOR].

  Print each of these `sentence` strings to the console.

  Example:
  "Steven is studying information design and visualization."

  ////////

  Recall the basic pattern for using a for() loop to iterate over
  items in an array:

  for(var i = 0; i < ARRAY.length; i++) {
    ... do something ...
  }

  */
for(var i = 0; i <= people.length; i++) {
  var sentence = name + " is studying " + major + ".";
  }
console.log(sentence)
